    <p> !DOCTYPE declaration is NOT case sensitive.</p> <br> 
        we can declare doctype as <br>
        !DOCTYPE html<br>
        !DocType html<br>
        !Doctype html<br>
        !doctype html<br>

    <p><b> !DOCTYPE html </b> <br>
    <br>The declaration is not an HTML tag. It is an "information" to the browser about what document type to expect. </p>
